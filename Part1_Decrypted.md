*While Daria is in her makeshift coffin, sleeping and regenerating, a raven with a small parchment tied to it lands on it briefly, puzzled. Tiss manages to quiet it long enough for to grab, revealing the following note:*

>Ercrain, provide this to our southern agent by Creon. His name is the
>key. Read this as well -- it will inform you as to our new protocol.
>
>>ALL. SOLAQUIN HAS REASON TO BELIEVE OUR CIPHER HAS A WEAKNESS ALLOWING THE WRONG KEY TO DECIPHER OUR MESSAGES. PLEASE ENACT THE FOLLOWING CHANGES. THIS IS THE LAST MESSAGE TO USE THIS ALGORITHM.
>>
>>FURTHER KEYS WILL BE PADDED TO LENGTH FIVE. YOUR CIPHERTEXT FACTOR WILL BE ACQUIRED SIMILARLY TO BEFORE BUT REMOVE THE DIVISOR. UPDATE THE MAP TO ALLOW A DASH AT THIRTY AND A COMMA AT THIRTY ONE THEN DIGITS ZERO THROUGH NINE AS THIRTY TWO UP.
>>
>>ONCE YOUR FACTOR IS ACQUIRED YOU WILL FIND THE HIGHEST PRIME IN THE FACTOR. YOU WILL AS BEFORE MULTIPLY EACH ROTATED CHARACTER VALUE BY THE FACTOR BUT YOU WILL THEN DIVIDE THAT RESULT BY THE PRIME AND THE REMAINDER IS NOW THE CIPHER VALUE. THE SIGNIFICAND OR WHOLE NUMBER OF THE DIVISION WILL THEN BE ENCODED AS BASE SIXTEEN ZERO THROUGH NINE A THROUGH F AS THE TWO PRIOR DIGITS. THUS A IS ELEVEN B IS TWELVE AND SO ON. THE REMAINDER IS ALSO TO BE ENCODED IN BASE SIXTEEN. THE SIGNIFICAND WILL BE PADDED TO TWO DIGITS. THE REMAINDER WILL BE PADDED TO THREE DIGITS. SOLVING YOUR CODE SHOULD BE EASY ENOUGH THERE ON OUT. WE CURRENTLY BELIEVE THIS CIPHER TO BE SECURE BUT SOLAQUIN INSISTS HE WILL IMPROVE SECURITY LATER.
>>
>>EVEN IF YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND YOUR MISSIONS OUR NEW FUTURE RELIES ON YOU. FAILURE WILL INCUR OUR EXTREME DISPLEASURE. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.
>>
>>THE FOLLOWING DIRECTIVE HAS BEEN ENCODED WITH THE NAME OF THE INDENTED RECIPIENT. THE ABOVE LETTER HAS BEEN DISTRIBUTED TO ALL. PLEASE REFER TO YOUR REGIONAL COMMANDER IF THIS IS UNCLEAR. THE WAVES HAVE JUST BEGUN. OUR MAGIC AND YOURS GROWS STRONGER DAY BY DAY. RACIN WILL BE OURS.
>
>This message is for him, as well, using the protocol described above. S was rather amused by some math involving our agent's name. It's all his game, though.
>
>>AKRESH - WE ARE VERY DISAPPOINTED THAT THE TOWN OF CREON STILL STANDS. THERE IS A RUMOR OF SOME UPSTARTS IN YOUR AREA. OBLITERATE THEM IF THE RUMORS ARE TRUE. OUT OF BRATH SKOZZIN HAS HELD THE VASLAN PENINSULA AND IS COMING YOUR WAY. CONTROL OF THE EAST PROVIDES US A PATH TO MARKYTH. CONSIDER THIS YOUR LAST WARNING. SKOZZIN WILL BE THERE WITHIN THE MONTH. SEND THE NEXT MESSAGE TO SKOZZIN. TELL HIM THE KEY IS HIS GOAL DESTINATION.
>  
>>SKOZZIN, IF AKRESH HAS NOT TAKEN CREON AND EXPANDED CONTROL BY THE TIME YOU HAVE ARRIVED, KILL HIM. FIND A NEW UNDERLING. SHIPPING LANES FROM THE GRAND WYSCENT ARE OF PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE.

# In Ercrain's Chambers

In Ercrain's room, you find this:

>WE PLAN TO HIT THE ENCLAVES.
>WE WILL ATTACK ON MIDSUMMERS EVE
>IT IS IMPORTANT TO THEIR PLANS. DO NOT FAIL.

He also has one other sheet of paper on him. It's far less marked up and much more succinct.


> The younger as he is  
> IT WILL BE DONE.
